You can use Cozystack as Kubernetes distribution for Bare Metal

### Overview

We created Cozystack primarily for our own needs, having vast experience in building reliable systems on bare metal infrastructure. This experience led to the formation of a separate boxed product, which is aimed at standardizing and providing a ready-to-use tool for managing your infrastructure.

Currently, Cozystack already solves a huge scope of infrastructure tasks: starting from provisioning bare metal servers, having a ready monitoring system, fast and reliable storage, a network fabric with the possibility of interconnect with your infrastructure, the ability to run virtual machines, databases, and much more right out of the box.

All this makes Cozystack a convenient platform for delivering and launching your application on Bare Metal.
