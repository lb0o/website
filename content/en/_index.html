title: "Cozystack: Free and open source PaaS framework for building clouds"
description: > 
  Transform a set of bare metal servers into an intelligent system with a simple REST API for spawning Kubernetes clusters, Databases-as-a-Service, virtual machines, load balancers, HTTP caching services, and other services with ease.

  Use Cozystack to build your own cloud or provide cost-effective development environments.
benefits:
  - title: API-first
    icon: fas fa-code
    description: >
      Cozystack is based on Kubernetes and involves close interaction with its API. It does not aim to completely hide the all elements behind a pretty UI or any sort of customizations. Instead, it provides a standard interface and educates users to work with basic primitives.
  - title: Standardization and Unification
    icon: fas fa-certificate
    description: >
      All components of the platform are based on proven open source tools and technologies which are widely known in the industry.
      We strive to use the most well-established and proven approaches, making the whole platform very simple and avoiding vendor lock-in.
  - title: Collaborate, not Compete
    icon: fas fa-handshake
    description: >
     We are proud of our community and closely interact with projects around it.
     If we build a platform feature that can be useful in an upstream project,
     we prefer to contribute it to that project, rather than keep it in the platform.
features:
  - title: Easy to Install
    icon: fas fa-wrench
    description: >
      With [talos-bootstrap](https://github.com/cozystack/talos-bootstrap/), we provide the ultimate easy installation method,
      allowing you to bootstrap Cozystack using PXE or ISO methods on servers in a bare data center.
      Using immutable OS helps maintain system consistency and ensure that everything works as expected.
  - title: Easy to Integrate
    icon: fas fa-plug
    description: >
      We provide a native Kubernetes RESTful API, widely recognized for its declarativity.
      Therefore, to integrate with your billing, it's enough to instruct your system to submit a specific YAML manifest defining the desired service to the Kubernetes API. 
      Cozystack will do the rest of the work for you.
  - title: Easy to Extend
    icon: fas fa-up-right-and-down-left-from-center
    description: >
      Each package in the platform consists of a set of YAML files. Therefore, everyone having some familiarity with Kubernetes primitives can modify or expand the platform. Package delivery is reliably handled by FluxCD, a well-known and widely used tool.
  - title: High Performance, Low Overhead
    icon: fas fa-gauge-high
    description: >
      We care about performance. That's why we adopt the most performant technologies balancing stability and functionality.
      Moreover, our unique tenant model enables efficient allocation of cloud resources for the control plane, ensuring cost-efficiency and the necessary level of security.
  - title: Built-in Monitoring & Alerts
    icon: fas fa-area-chart
    description: >
      Each instance of each service is accompanied by a set of pre-configured dashboards and alerts.
      You can create separate monitoring hubs for every tenant or combine them into one.
  - title: Built-In UI for App Management
    icon: fas fa-window-maximize
    description: >
      While the primary goal of the platform is to provide a beautiful API, it also has a dashboard for deploying applications.
      The Web UI facilitates a quick dive into the platform and provides a visual demonstration of its capabilities.
